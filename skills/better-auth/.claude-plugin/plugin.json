  "description": "Production-ready authentication framework for TypeScript with Cloudflare D1 support via Drizzle ORM or Kysely. Self-hosted alternative to Clerk or Auth.js for Cloudflare Workers projects. CRITICAL: better-auth requires Drizzle ORM or Kysely - NO direct D1 adapter exists. Supports social providers, 2FA, passkeys, organizations, RBAC. Prevents 13 common auth errors including D1 adapter misconfiguration, nanostore session invalidation with TanStack Query, schema generation, CORS, OAuth flows, and JWT handling.",
