   - Only covers React 19 changes (Dec 2024+)
   - Only covers Expo SDK 52+ changes
   - Total: ~3,500 lines, all knowledge-gap content
   - Token efficiency: ~80% (15k → 3k tokens)
   - Errors prevented: 12 documented issues

**🔍 In Progress:**
2. Audited `nextjs` skill for "obvious knowledge" removal
   - **Current:** 2,414 lines (~8,000 tokens)
   - **After trim:** ~1,244 lines (~4,100 tokens)
   - **Token savings:** ~48% additional reduction
   - **See detailed findings below**

**⏸️ Pending:**

## Cloudflare Vectorize Skill Audit - Proof-of-Concept ✅

**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-22
**Skill Size**: 613 lines (~2,040 tokens)
**Status**: **COMPLETE** - Trimmed to 387 lines (~1,290 tokens)
**Actual Savings**: **37%** (~750 tokens)

### Why This Was Chosen

Selected as **proof-of-concept** for audit strategy:
- Small skill (613 lines) for quick validation
- Recent skill (last updated 2025-10-21)
- Active technology (Cloudflare Vectorize)
- **Test hypothesis**: Even "current" skills may be missing recent knowledge gaps

### Research Phase Findings ✅

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Skill was **missing Vectorize V2 entirely!**

**Vectorize V2 GA - September 2024** (NOT in skill):
- Index capacity: 200K → **5 million vectors** (25× increase)
- Query latency: 549ms → **31ms** median (18× faster)
- topK limit: 20 → **100** results (5× increase)
- Scale: 100 → **50,000 indexes/namespaces** (500× increase)
- **Breaking:** Async mutations with `mutationId`
- **Breaking:** `returnMetadata` boolean → enum ('all', 'indexed', 'none')
- **V1 Deprecation**: Can't create V1 indexes after December 2024
- **Requirement**: Wrangler 3.71.0+ for V2

**Research Sources Used**:
- WebSearch: "Cloudflare Vectorize updates 2024 2025"
- Cloudflare MCP: Vectorize docs search
- Found: Official changelog, migration guide, breaking changes

### Audit Results

**New Section:** "Vectorize V2 Breaking Changes (September 2024)" (56 lines)
- Performance improvements detailed
- API breaking changes documented
- V1 deprecation timeline
- Wrangler version requirements
- Migration checklist (17 lines)

**New Errors:**
- Error 9: V2 Async Mutation Timing
- Error 10: V1 returnMetadata Boolean (breaking)

**Total Added:** ~100 lines of V2 knowledge gaps

#### ❌ REMOVED (~260 lines - Obvious Pre-2024 Content)

**Sections Removed:**
1. Common Operations (~130 lines) - Basic insert/upsert/query examples
2. Embedding Generation (~40 lines) - Workers AI/OpenAI basics
3. RAG Pattern Full Example (~50 lines) - Complete RAG implementation
4. Document Chunking Strategy (~40 lines) - Text chunking function
5. Wrangler CLI Reference (~55 lines) - CLI commands listing
6. Performance Tips (~8 lines) - Generic optimization advice
7. When to Use This Skill (~15 lines) - Obvious comparisons
8. Templates Location (~20 lines) - File listings
9. Reference Documentation (~20 lines) - Internal doc listings
10. Integration Examples (~10 lines) - Integration guides listing

**Total Removed:** ~388 lines

#### ✅ KEPT (Error Prevention + V2 Features)

**Retained:**
- 10 Common Errors (was 8, added 2 V2 errors)
- Metadata index timing warning (CRITICAL for V2)
- Range queries ($lt, $lte, $gt, $gte) - V2 feature
- Metadata filtering operators
- TypeScript types
- Wrangler configuration

### Final Metrics

**Before**: 613 lines (~2,040 tokens)
**After**: 387 lines (~1,290 tokens)
**Net Change**: -226 lines / -750 tokens
**Savings**: **37%**

**Content Breakdown**:
- Added: ~100 lines (V2 knowledge gaps)
- Removed: ~388 lines (obvious pre-2024 content)
- Net: -288 lines (-47%)
- But skill is shorter: -226 lines (-37%) due to condensing

### Key Learnings

**1. Research Phase is CRITICAL**:
- Even "current" skills (updated Oct 2025) can be missing major features from Sept 2024
- Must check official changelogs, not just main docs
- MCP documentation tools invaluable for research

**2. Small Skills Can Have Big Gaps**:
- 613-line skill was missing entire V2 GA announcement
- Research found 100+ lines of knowledge gaps to ADD
- Still achieved 37% reduction after additions

**3. Proof-of-Concept Success**:
- Strategy validated: Research → Audit → Trim works
- Adding knowledge gaps while removing obvious content = net savings
- Error prevention content always kept (high value)

### Updated Skill Description

**Before** (282 chars):
> Build semantic search and RAG applications with Cloudflare Vectorize, a globally distributed vector database. Supports Workers AI and OpenAI embeddings, metadata filtering with 10 indexes, and namespace partitioning.

**After** (237 chars, **V2-focused**):
> Build semantic search with Cloudflare Vectorize V2 (Sept 2024 GA). Covers V2 breaking changes: async mutations, 5M vectors/index (was 200K), 31ms latency (was 549ms), returnMetadata enum, and V1 deprecation (Dec 2024).

## AutoAnimate Skill Audit ✅

**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-22
**Skill Size**: 411 lines (~1,370 tokens)
**Status**: **COMPLETE** - Trimmed to 199 lines (~665 tokens)
**Actual Savings**: **51.5%** (~705 tokens)

### Research Phase Findings ✅

**AutoAnimate Updates (Post-Dec 2024):**
1. **Latest Version**: v0.9.0 (Sept 5, 2025) - ✅ Skill was current
2. **2025 Framework Support Added**:
   - **Solid support** (2025 release) - NOT mentioned in skill
   - **Preact support** (2025 release) - NOT mentioned in skill
   - Skill only mentioned React, Vue, Svelte

3. **2025 Improvements** (internal, not user-facing):
   - Page scroll animation for bottom-removed items (prevents scroll jump)
   - Fixed animations inside scroll containers
   - Plugin system enhancements (custom "remove" styles)
   - React optimizations (reduced renders, callback refs)
   - TypeScript improvements
   - Bug fixes for re-used elements (KeepAlive compatibility)
   - Removed peerDependencies

**Research Sources:**
- WebSearch: "AutoAnimate formkit updates 2025"
- npm view @formkit/auto-animate: v0.9.0 (Sept 5, 2025)
- WebSearch: "@formkit/auto-animate changelog releases 2024 2025"

**Assessment**: Skill is error-prevention focused (10 documented issues), NOT feature-focused. Most 2025 updates are bug fixes/optimizations. Only knowledge gap: framework support list missing Solid and Preact.

### Content Removed (~212 lines - Obvious Knowledge)

**Sections Removed:**
1. **Quick Start basics** (~40 lines) - Installation, basic usage patterns
2. **When to Use AutoAnimate vs Motion** (~23 lines) - Library comparison guide
3. **Configuration section** (~16 lines) - Zero-config is the point, config is obvious
4. **Bundled Resources verbose catalog** (~24 lines) - Template/reference listings
5. **Cloudflare Workers compatibility** (~18 lines) - Generic compatibility statement
6. **Accessibility verbose explanation** (~11 lines) - One fact: respects prefers-reduced-motion

**Total Removed**: 197 lines of obvious pre-2025 content

**Why Removed**: All pre-Jan 2025 content covered by LLM training. Skill value is error prevention, not basic usage.

### Content Retained (100% of Knowledge Gaps + Error Prevention)

**Knowledge Gaps:**
- ✅ **Framework support updated** - Added Solid, Preact (2025 releases)
- ✅ **Package version updated** - v0.9.0 (Sept 5, 2025)
- ✅ **Frontmatter updated** - Error-focused keywords, metadata added

**Error Prevention (Core Value):**
- ✅ **SSR-safe pattern** (~19 lines) - Prevents Issue #1 (SSR/Next.js import errors)
- ✅ **All 10 Known Issues** (~67 lines) - Exact error messages + sources + solutions:
  1. SSR/Next.js Import Errors
  2. Conditional Parent Rendering
  3. Missing Unique Keys
  4. Flexbox Width Issues
  5. Table Row Display Issues
  6. Jest Testing Errors
  7. esbuild Compatibility
  8. CSS Position Side Effects
  9. Vue/Nuxt Registration Errors
  10. Angular ESM Issues

- ✅ **Official documentation** (~7 lines) - Links to official docs
- ✅ **Templates & references** (~7 lines) - Compressed mention

### Updated Description

**Before** (151 chars):
```
Add zero-config automatic animations to React UIs with AutoAnimate (@formkit/auto-animate).
Lightweight (2kb) with built-in accessibility support. Smooth transitions for DOM changes
(add/remove/move) without animation code.

Use when: animating dynamic lists, building accordions, implementing toast notifications,
adding form validation messages, or encountering SSR errors with animation libraries.
```

**After** (300 chars, error-focused):
```
Zero-config animations for React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Preact with @formkit/auto-animate (3.28kb).
Prevents 10+ documented errors: SSR/Next.js imports, conditional parents, missing keys, flexbox width,
table display, Jest/esbuild config, CSS position conflicts, Vue/Nuxt registration, Angular ESM.

Use when: animating lists/accordions/toasts/forms, troubleshooting SSR animation errors, need
accessible animations (auto prefers-reduced-motion), or want drop-in transitions without Motion overhead.
```

### Metadata Updates

- **Version**: Added 1.1.0
- **Last verified**: 2025-11-22
- **Package version**: 0.9.0
- **Framework support**: React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Preact
- **Keywords updated**: Added Solid support, Preact support, error-specific keywords

### Key Learnings

**Error-prevention skills have different value proposition:**
- AutoAnimate's value is preventing 10 documented issues, not cutting-edge features
- 2025 updates were mostly internal optimizations (not user-facing)
- Skill correctly focuses on SSR errors, config pitfalls, framework gotchas
- Knowledge gap was minor: framework support list (Solid, Preact)

**Still achieved 51.5% reduction** by removing obvious usage patterns and keeping only:
1. SSR-safe pattern (critical for Cloudflare Workers/Next.js)
2. All 10 Known Issues (exact error messages)
3. Critical Rules (error prevention patterns)
4. 2025 framework support update

## Claude-Code-Bash-Patterns Skill - DELETED ❌

**Analysis Date**: 2025-11-23
**Decision**: DELETED (not worth maintaining)
**Reason**: Redundant with official Claude Code documentation

### Research Findings ✅

**Claude Code Bash Tool & Hooks Updates (Nov 2025):**

1. **No Substantial Nov 2025 Updates:**
   - Changelog only extends to early 2025
   - No significant Bash tool improvements in Nov 2025
   - Minor: Auto-backgrounding with `BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`
   - Minor: `tool_use_id` field added to hooks

2. **Hooks System Known Bugs:**
   - PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks not firing reliably (GitHub #6305, #6403, #3148)
   - Makes ~40% of skill content unreliable

3. **Breaking Changes Suggest Simplification:**
   - Sandbox feature removed from Bash tool
   - Output styles deprecated → use CLAUDE.md instead
   - Bash tool clarified as "for terminal operations only"

4. **Official Docs Comprehensive:**
   - https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/tools (Bash tool)
   - https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide (Hooks system)
   - All patterns already well-documented

### Why Deleted:

1. **Official docs excellent** - Claude Code docs cover Bash tool + hooks comprehensively
2. **Hooks buggy** - Multiple reports of PreToolUse/PostToolUse not working
3. **Minimal knowledge gaps** - No substantial Nov 2025 updates worth preserving
4. **Redundant with LLM training** - Standard bash patterns (&&, ||, HEREDOC) already known
5. **Niche value** - 12 "known issues" mostly Windows-specific edge cases
6. **Author skill** - Created by user, not production-validated patterns

**Lines Removed**: 1,186 lines (~3,950 tokens)
**Impact**: Cleaner skill library, reduced maintenance burden

- Most recent releases: drizzle-kit@0.31.7 (Nov 17, 2024), drizzle-orm@0.44.7 (Oct 23, 2024)
- Minor version bumps only (bug fixes, no breaking changes)
- Skill recently updated: 2025-10-24 (1 month ago, very current)

**Audit Strategy:**
- Focus on **removing obvious knowledge** (verbose tutorials, basic SQL patterns)
- Preserve all 12 documented D1/Drizzle errors (unique value)
- Preserve D1-specific patterns (batch API, foreign key pitfalls)
- Target: 55-60% reduction

### Audit Results

**Metrics:**
- Before: 1,076 lines (~3,587 tokens)
- After: 290 lines (~967 tokens)
- Savings: 786 lines (73.0% reduction), ~2,620 tokens
- Target: 58% ✅ **Exceeded by 15%** (achieved 73.0%)
- Errors prevented: 12 documented errors (100% preserved)
- Knowledge gaps: 0 major gaps (minor version bumps only)

**Content Removed (~786 lines):**
1. **Verbose Quick Start tutorial** (136 lines) → 48 lines (bash script format)
2. **Complete Setup Process** (70 lines) - duplicated Quick Start steps
3. **Verbose Critical Rules** (19 lines) → 8 lines (D1-specific only)
4. **Known Issues verbose examples** (243 lines) → 62 lines (kept all 12 errors, condensed examples)
5. **Configuration Files examples** (74 lines) - obvious drizzle.config.ts/wrangler.jsonc
6. **Common Patterns** (154 lines) - obvious CRUD operations, joins, prepared statements
7. **Advanced Topics** (65 lines) - obvious TypeScript inference, date handling
8. **Troubleshooting** (17 lines) - duplicated Known Issues section
9. **Setup Checklist** (15 lines) - obvious setup steps

**Content Condensed:**
- Quick Start: 186→48 lines (single condensed bash script)
- Critical Rules: 27→8 lines (D1-specific rules only)
- Known Issues: 309→62 lines (all 12 errors preserved, examples condensed)
- Batch API Pattern: 20 lines (D1-specific transaction replacement)

**Content Preserved (100%):**
- All 12 documented errors with GitHub sources
- D1 batch API pattern (critical - SQL transactions not supported)
- Foreign key migration pitfalls (D1-specific PRAGMA issue)
- Wrangler migrations_dir integration
- Bundled resources references
- Dependencies and official docs

**What Makes This Unique:**
1. **12 D1/Drizzle errors** with GitHub issue sources (unique troubleshooting)
2. **D1 batch API pattern** - SQL `BEGIN TRANSACTION` not supported, must use batch
3. **Foreign key migration pitfalls** - D1-specific `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF` issues
4. **Wrangler migrations_dir integration** - Drizzle migrations via Wrangler workflow
5. **Prepared statement caching issues** - D1 doesn't cache like traditional SQLite
