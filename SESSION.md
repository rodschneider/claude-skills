## Session Achievements

**Completed Tasks**:
✅ Optimized all 58 skill descriptions (100%)
✅ Conducted 2 quality reviews (caught and fixed 7 issues)
✅ Updated 3 documentation files with learnings
✅ Established proven optimization pattern
✅ Created SKILLS_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md (comprehensive analysis)

## Phase 2: Knowledge-Gap-Focused Skills & Content Audit 🔄

**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-11-22
**Focus**: Remove "obvious knowledge" from skills, keep only knowledge gaps (post-Jan 2025) and error prevention

### Objective

With LLM knowledge cutoff at January 2025, optimize skills to contain ONLY:
1. **Knowledge Gaps** - Information from Dec 2024 onward (not in LLM training)
2. **Error Prevention** - Exact error messages with solutions (prevents trial-and-error)

Remove "obvious knowledge" that LLMs with Jan 2025 cutoff already know.

### Progress

**✅ Completed:**
1. Created `react-native-expo` skill (59th skill) - **Knowledge-gap-focused from the start**
   - Only covers React Native 0.76-0.82+ updates (Oct 2024 - Oct 2025)
   - Only covers React 19 changes (Dec 2024+)
   - Only covers Expo SDK 52+ changes
   - Total: ~3,500 lines, all knowledge-gap content
   - Token efficiency: ~80% (15k → 3k tokens)
   - Errors prevented: 12 documented issues

**🔍 In Progress:**
2. Audited `nextjs` skill for "obvious knowledge" removal
   - **Current:** 2,414 lines (~8,000 tokens)
   - **After trim:** ~1,244 lines (~4,100 tokens)
   - **Token savings:** ~48% additional reduction
   - **See detailed findings below**

**⏸️ Pending:**
3. Apply learnings to remaining 57 skills
4. Document content audit process
5. Update skill creation guidelines
